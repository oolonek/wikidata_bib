3 modules: 
- string match-based tagger,
- machine learning-based tagger and
- pre-trained taggers

Ruby on Rails and MySQL as a backend database. RESTful APIs were implemented in C++ and Perl. All

ezTag is a versatile annotation tool that enables users to perform both simple annotation and complex interactive learning for adaptive concept tagging.
