## What Is an Individual? Biology Seeks Clues in Information Theory.

Even on Earth today, it’s clear that nature has a sloppy disregard for boundaries: Viruses rely on host cells to make copies of themselves. Bacteria share and swap genes, while higher-order species hybridize. Thousands of slime mold amoebas cooperatively assemble into towers to spread their spores. Worker ants and bees can be nonreproductive members of social-colony “superorganisms.” Lichens are symbiotic composites of fungi and algae or cyanobacteria. Even humans contain at least as many bacterial cells as “self” cells, the microbes in our gut inextricably linked with our development, physiology and survival.

“biology as a field is completely under-theorized,” said Manfred Laubichler, a theoretical biologist at Arizona State University. “It’s very much still an empirically driven discipline.”

arbitrary ways that concepts of individuality were applied in the study of natural selection and other biological processes.

Unfortunately, “once gene theory took over, it became a biology of things,” said Scott Gilbert, a developmental biologist at Swarthmore College. But now that’s starting to change again. “Twentieth-century biology was a biology of things,” he said. “Twenty-first-century biology is a biology of processes.”

 the organismal individual, an entity that is shaped by environmental factors but is strongly self-organizing

 The second type of individuality is the colonial form, ant colony or a spiderweb.

 The third type is driven almost entirely by the environment.

 according to Krakauer. “What we’re trying to do is discover a whole zoo of life forms that extend far beyond what we have conventionally called living,” he said.

 And if researchers can gain a better understanding of the factors that have the greatest impact on a system’s individuality, they might learn more about evolutionary transitions like the emergence of multicellularity.

“I think that defining fundamental quantities helps us to suddenly start to see dynamics that we didn’t see before, and understand processes that we hadn’t thought of before,” 

“Organisms aren’t just individuated,” he said. “They have access to information about their individuation.” To him, the kind of information that Krakauer and Flack’s framework uses might not be “knowable” to an organism: “It’s not clear to me that the organism could use these information metrics that they define in a way that would allow it to preserve its existence,” he said.


# Dataset (Google Advanced Search Engine Optimization)

 Google's approach to dataset discovery makes use of schema.org and other metadata standards that can be added to pages that describe datasets

 https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch/

 Here are some examples of what can qualify as a dataset:
 - Anything that looks like a dataset to you

Add the required properties. For information about where to put structured data on the page, watch JSON-LD structured data: Where to insert on the page.
Follow the guidelines.
Validate your code using the Rich Results Test.
Deploy a few pages that include your structured data and use the URL Inspection tool to test how Google sees the page

Here's an example for datasets using JSON-LD and schema.org syntax.


The full definition of Dataset is available at schema.org/Dataset.

Use unique names for distinct datasets whenever possible.

A tabular dataset is one organized primarily in terms of a grid of rows and columns. For pages that embed tabular datasets, you can also create more explicit markup, building on the basic approach described above. At this time we understand a variation of CSVW ("CSV on the Web", see W3C), provided in parallel to user-oriented tabular content on the HTML page.

Monitor rich results with Search Console

## Understand how structured data works

Google uses structured data that it finds on the web to understand the content of the page, as well as to gather information about the web and the world in general. For example, here is a JSON-LD structured data snippet that might appear on a recipe page, describing the title of the recipe, the author of the recipe, and other details

 Most Search structured data uses schema.org vocabulary, but you should rely on the documentation on developers.google.com as definitive for Google Search behavior


Google Search supports structured data in the following formats, unless documented otherwise:

JSON-LD* (Recommended)	
A JavaScript notation embedded in a <script> tag in the page head or body. 

Microdata	An open-community HTML specification used to nest structured data within HTML content.

RDFa	An HTML5 extension that supports linked data by introducing HTML tag attributes

## Making it easier to discover datasets
https://www.blog.google/products/search/making-it-easier-discover-datasets/

To enable easy access to this data, we launched Dataset Search, so that scientists, data journalists, data geeks, or anyone else can find the data required for their work and their stories, or simply to satisfy their intellectual curiosity.

Similar to how Google Scholar works, Dataset Search lets you find datasets wherever they’re hoste

Our approach is based on an open standard for describing this information (schema.org) and anybody who publishes data can describe their dataset this way. We encourage dataset providers, large and small, to adopt this common standard so that all datasets are part of this robust ecosystem.

A search tool like this one is only as good as the metadata that data publishers are willing to provide. We hope to see many of you use the open standards to describe your data

## The Human Protein Atlas 

### https://www.proteinatlas.org/about/assays+annotation


The single cell RNA sequencing dataset is based on meta-analysis of literature on single cell RNA sequencing and single cell databases that include healthy human tissue

In total, single cell transcriptomics data for 13 tissues and peripheral blood mononucleated cells (PBMCs) were analyzed. These datasets were respectively retrieved from the Single Cell Expression Atlas, the Human Cell Atlas, the Gene Expression Omnibus, and the European Genome-phenome Archive. The complete list of references is shown in the table below.


Unfiltered data were used as input for downstream analysis with an in-house pipeline using Scanpy (version 1.4.4.post1) in Python 3.7.3

Defining cell types

Each of the 192 different cell type clusters were manually annotated based on an extensive survey of >500 well-known tissue and cell type-specific markers, including both markers from the original publications, and additional markers used in pathology diagnostics. For each cluster, one main cell type was chosen by taking into consideration the expression of different markers. For a few clusters, no main cell type could be selected, and these clusters were not used for classification. The most relevant markers are presented in a heatmap on the Cell Type Atlas, in order to clarify cluster annotation to visitors.

Cell type dendrogram
The cell type dendrogram presented on the Cell Type Atlas shows the relationship between the single cell types based on genome-wide expression. The dendrogram is based on agglomerative clustering of 1 - Spearman's rho between cell types using Ward's criterion. The dendrogram was then transformed into a hierarchical graph, thus where link distances were normalized to emphasize graph connections rather than link distances. Link width is proportional to the distance from the root, and are colored according to cell type group if only one cell type group is present among connected leaves.
