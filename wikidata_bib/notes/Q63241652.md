The challenges of big data biology
==================================
  
  [@wikidata:Q63241652]  

# Highlights

Big data biology also raises fundamental questions in the philosophy of science: for example, what is a good dataset, and how can reliable knowledge be extracted from big data?

Biological concepts – no matter how loosely defined – are always embedded in broader theoretical perspectives on how nature works.

Does a reliance on big data change the very idea of biological discovery and what counts as biological knowledge? 

Biology is notoriously fragmented in its methods, goals, instruments and conceptual frameworks.

Philosophy  can help to confront some of the key challenges. One term may be used to refer to different processes, or different definitions may apply to the same term. This profound fragmentation, which philosophers call pluralism.

Databases need to be accessed through a common ‘query’ system. which terminologies should be used to classify the data and integrate them with other data?

The choice and definition of keywords used to classify and retrieve data matters enormously to their subsequent interpretation. 

Acknowledge that no data are ’raw’ in the sense of being independent from human interpretation.

Philosophers of science have argued that pluralism may be beneficial when attempting to extract knowledge about the highly complex and variable processes encountered in the life sciences.

Biologists often have feelings of unease about the quality of data and metadata found in online databases, particularly when the relevant data- bases are not curated by experts in the specific field and/or organism.

Data are ’relational’: in other words, the objects that best serve as data can change depending on the standards, goals and methods used to generate, process and interpret those objects as evidence.

Access to original samples also provides a concrete point of contact between research traditions and approaches.

Automated data analysis is an exciting prospect for biological discovery. Far from making human judgement unnecessary, the increasing power of computational algorithms requires a proportional increase in critical thinking.

# Comments

Philosophical insights to confront key challenges in biology - kind of the general idea of the Philosophy of biology session. 

Multilabel, single concept definitions (such as in Wikidata) might satisfy some of these issues

All data produced is stained by human interpretation. That explicits the need to have good definitions for concepts in single-cell biology to benefit from the data, even in the "raw" format.
